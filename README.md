# About This Project

This project is part of the International STEAM Azerbaijan Festival (SAF) 2023, under the Hackathon category. Centered around the theme "Gamification of Education", our project aims to revolutionize kids' learning experiences.

## Our Mission

In a world increasingly connected by the internet, proficiency in English is essential.

Our research indicates that Azerbaijan ranks 83rd globally in English proficiency and trails behind in the European region.

Addressing this gap is crucial.

## Our Solution

In response, we've created an interactive website designed to teach English to children in an engaging and enjoyable manner.

Our approach combines the fun of storytelling with the fundamentals of language learning, fostering an enriching educational journey.
